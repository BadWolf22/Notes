  * Indigenous populations: Aztecs, Mayans, Incans ("tribes" were broken up and basically independent)
    * Civilizations were extremely advanced for the time: <ins>advanced urban planning</ins>, <ins>running water</ins>, 
    * Civilizations are not *gone*
    * Columbus tried to get to India (failed, landed in Caribbean) (they didn't actually think Earth was flat)
      * Took slaves but they just ran away and hid lol
  * Triangular Trade: Europe, Africa, and Asia -> Americas & Americas -> them.
    * Sugarcane -> Americas & Tobacco -> them
      * Sugar = **Important** Because molasses, tea, only grows in humid/hot
        * Slaves worked to death for 3ish years and replaced with new one (b/c more cost efficient)
    * Slaves taken to mainly Middle/South America at first, then to North America in 1600s
  * Polynesian Triangle: Middle/South American natives traded w/ Pacific natives long before 1492 (No exploitation)
  * 3 Gs Gold, God, and Glory
    * Money/resources
    * Basically no chance for peace. Especially with the present religious beliefs

    * Told Europe nobody could dabble in Western hemisphere but us.

  <summary>Day 4 - Ch. 5 - Middle and South America</summary>
  
  * Powerty & drug violence riddles Middle/South America
  * Drug demand mostly Europe & NA
    * Profit comes from **THOSE BUYING THE DRUGS** (Problem is not just Middle/Central, is the *world's* problem)

  * Climate change = extreme weather (*your* extreme weather becomes more extreme and more common)
    * Central America = more drought, Amazon = too much rain (flooding)
    * Latin America most worried about Climate change
    * Places like US & China not worried b/c we don't really feel the effects
      * We are rich countries. We just fix it with money
      * They don't have money to fix it because of <ins>unstable governments (often caused by us)</ins>
    * Extreme temperatures spike after cars become common in 1950s-60s (lots of infrastructure to support cars)
    * Global natural disasters increased like 3x since 1980s.
    * Crop yields dropping as much as 50% in most places bc of a 3 degree Celcius change by 2050. (keep in mind that populations will continue rising)
      * Plant more to get less while needing more means more area needed = bad news.
    * Cattle grazing contribues to deforestation bc of grazing land

  * Mass migration from climate change leads to lots of issues
    * Farmers leave country to find new farm jobs.
    * Farm land decreasing
    * Not enough work
    * People move from rural to urban areas (Intra-national not just Inter-national migration)
    * Urban areas then contribute even more to climate change
  
  * Most places other than NA
    * Inner = wealthier/privileged, Outer = lower-income/less-privileged
    * Infrastructure in inner city, not much further from city.
      * Richer live where more infrastructure is
