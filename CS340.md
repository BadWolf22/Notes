> **Arrays**
* Arrays must have the same data types inside.
* Used to implement other data structures.
* Always contiguous in memory.
* Array can not change size in most languages.

  <summary>### Initializing Arrays</summary>
  
  ```c++
  int A[5]; // array will be initialized by garbage
  int B[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 500};
  int C[5] = {1, 2}; // Others will be initialized by 0
  int D[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}; //Array of 6 is created
  ```
</details>

  <summary>### Accessing Arrays</summary>
  
  ```c++
  cout << A[1] // Using index
    << 1[A]    // Using index outside
    << *(A+1)  // Using pointer
    << endl;
  for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) { // Accessing the whole array
    cout << A[i] << endl;  
  }
  ```

  <summary>### Array Memory Location</summary>
  
  ```c++
  // This code prints the memory locations of each element of the array.
  // Shows contiguous
  int A[5] = {2, 4, 7, 2, 9};
  for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) {
    cout << &A[i] << endl; 
    // The & means return memory location instead of value at location
  }
  ```
</details>
</div>

> **Pointers**: indirect addressing (think of a library and books)
* Value stored in variable (book)
* Variable stored in location (shelf)
* Address (floor number + shelf number + location number) <- used to access memory location of variable
* Name (name of bookshelf ["new books", "math"]) <- not all locations have a name.
* Pointer (an index card for a book that tells you where to find book)
  * Pointer is also a variable so it has its own (value, location, address, name)
