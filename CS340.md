> **Arrays**
* Arrays must have the same data types inside.
* Used to implement other data structures.
* Always contiguous in memory.
* Array can not change size in most languages.

  <summary>### Initializing Arrays</summary>
  
  ```c++
  int A[5]; // array will be initialized by garbage
  int B[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 500};
  int C[5] = {1, 2}; // Others will be initialized by 0
  int D[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}; //Array of 6 is created
  ```
</details>

  <summary>### Accessing Arrays</summary>
  
  ```c++
  cout << A[1] // Using index
    << 1[A]    // Using index outside
    << *(A+1)  // Using pointer
    << endl;
  for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) { // Accessing the whole array
    cout << A[i] << endl;  
  }
  ```

  <summary>### Array Memory Location</summary>
  
  ```c++
  // This code prints the memory locations of each element of the array.
  // Shows contiguous
  int A[5] = {2, 4, 7, 2, 9};
  for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) {
    cout << &A[i] << endl; 
    // The & means return memory location instead of value at location
  }
  ```

</div>

> **Pointers**: indirect addressing (think of a library and books)
* Value stored in variable (book)
* Variable stored in location (shelf)
* Address (floor number + shelf number + location number) <- used to access memory location of variable
* Name (name of bookshelf ["new books", "math"]) <- not all locations have a name.
* Pointer (an index card for a book that tells you where to find book)
  * Pointer is also a variable so it has its own (value, location, address, name)

> **Pointer = variable whose value is the address of another variable.**
* Pointer (address type is common in C/C++)
* Operations on pointers:
  * & = Referencing: Obtain address of variable from its name
  * \* = Dereferencing: _Create_ a variable name for a given address

<div markdown="1">
<details>
  <summary>### Referencing</summary>
  
  ```c++
  #include <iostream>

  using namespace std;
  int main() {
    int var1;
    char var2[10];

    cout << "var1 address: " << &var1 << endl;
    cout << "var2 address: " << &var2 << endl;

    return 0;
  }
  ```
  ```c++
  Output:
    var1 address: 0xbfebd5c0
    var2 address: 0xbfebd5c6
  ```

  <summary>### Dereferencing</summary>
  
  ```c++
  int x = 3;
  int *y;
  y = &x;
  // *y is an l-value (left  side)
  // &x is a  r-value (right side)
  ```
  ```c++
  int x, *y;
  // Initial states
    // Address of x: 2000
    // value of x: 500
    // value of y: 8000
  y = &x;     // value of y: 2000
  *y = 100;   // value of x: 100
  y = y + 10; // value of y: 2040 (2000 + 10 cells * 4 bytes/cell)
  *y = 100;   // Points to an unknown location, **issue**!
  ```
